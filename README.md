Normalization methodologies for short range time series forecasting in predictive sequential evaluation frameworks

This work aims to study the power and usability of various simple machine learning and
deep learning models that work with time series of various data sources and try to
predict. In the field of time series analysis predictive models are of utmost importance
when dealing with tasks like weather forcasting, predicting measures of energy
consumption, or grasp how certain economics pointers extrapolate in time. It is
widespread to use traditional statistical methods like ARIMA or ETS, however machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, among them simple neural networks, e.g.
k-NN, are promising alternatives. In this work, the main goal is to compare the errors
and robustness of a few models and investigate how the data preprocessing may have a
significant footprint on efficiency.
